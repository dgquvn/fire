# Doxyfile 1.8.10

# This file describes the settings to be used by the documentation system
# doxygen (www.doxygen.org) for a project.
#
# All text after a double hash (##) is considered a comment and is placed in
# front of the TAG it is preceding.
#
# All text after a single hash (#) is considered a comment and will be ignored.
# The format is:
# TAG = value [value, ...]
# For lists, items can also be appended using:
# TAG += value [value, ...]
# Values that contain spaces should be placed between quotes (\" \").

#---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Project related configuration options
#---------------------------------------------------------------------------

# This tag specifies the encoding used for all characters in the config file
# that follow. The default is UTF-8 which is also the encoding used for all text
# before the first occurrence of this tag. Doxygen uses libiconv (or the iconv
# built into libc) for the transcoding. See http://www.gnu.org/software/libiconv
# for the list of possible encodings.
# The default value is: UTF-8.

DOXYFILE_ENCODING      = UTF-8

# The PROJECT_NAME tag is a single word (or a sequence of words surrounded by
# double-quotes, unless you are using Doxywizard) that should identify the
# project for which the documentation is generated. This name is used in the
# title of most generated pages and in a few other places.
# The default value is: My Project.

PROJECT_NAME           = "Fire"

# The PROJECT_NUMBER tag can be used to enter a project or revision number. This
# could be handy for archiving the generated documentation or if some version
# control system is used.

PROJECT_NUMBER         =

# Using the PROJECT_BRIEF tag one can provide an optional one line description
# for a project that appears at the top of each page and should give viewer a
# quick idea about the purpose of the project. Keep the description short.

PROJECT_BRIEF          =

# With the PROJECT_LOGO tag one can specify a logo or an icon that is included
# in the documentation. The maximum height of the logo should not exceed 55
# pixels and the maximum width should not exceed 200 pixels. Doxygen will copy
# the logo to the output directory.

PROJECT_LOGO           =

# The OUTPUT_DIRECTORY tag is used to specify the (relative or absolute) path
# into which the generated documentation will be written. If a relative path is
# entered, it will be relative to the location where doxygen was started. If
# left blank the current directory will be used.

OUTPUT_DIRECTORY       = @CMAKE_CURRENT_SOURCE_DIR@/docs/api

# If the CREATE_SUBDIRS tag is set to YES then doxygen will create 4096 sub-
# directories (in 2 levels) under the output directory of each output format and
# will distribute the generated files over these directories. Enabling this
# option can be useful when feeding doxygen a huge amount of source files, where
# putting all generated files in the same directory would otherwise causes
# performance problems for the file system.
# The default value is: NO.

CREATE_SUBDIRS         = NO

# If the ALLOW_UNICODE_NAMES tag is set to YES, doxygen will allow non-ASCII
# characters to appear in the names of generated files. If set to NO, non-ASCII
# characters will be escaped, for example _xE3_x81_x84 will be used for Unicode
# U+3044.
# The default value is: NO.

ALLOW_UNICODE_NAMES    = NO

# The OUTPUT_LANGUAGE tag is used to specify the language in which all
# documentation generated by doxygen is written. Doxygen will use this
# information to generate all constant output in the proper language.
# Possible values are: Afrikaans, Arabic, Armenian, Brazilian, Catalan, Chinese,
# Chinese-Traditional, Croatian, Czech, Danish, Dutch, English (United States),
# Esperanto, Farsi (Persian), Finnish, French, German, Greek, Hungarian,
# Indonesian, Italian, Japanese, Japanese-en (Japanese with English messages),
# Korean, Korean-en (Korean with English messages), Latvian, Lithuanian,
# Macedonian, Norwegian, Persian (Farsi), Polish, Portuguese, Romanian, Russian,
# Serbian, Serbian-Cyrillic, Slovak, Slovene, Spanish, Swedish, Turkish,
# Ukrainian and Vietnamese.
# The default value is: English.

OUTPUT_LANGUAGE        = English

# If the BRIEF_MEMBER_DESC tag is set to YES, doxygen will include brief member
# descriptions after the members that are listed in the file and class
# documentation (similar to Javadoc). Set to NO to disable this.
# The default value is: YES.

BRIEF_MEMBER_DESC      = YES

# If the REPEAT_BRIEF tag is set to YES, doxygen will prepend the brief
# description of a member or function before the detailed description
#
# Note: If both HIDE_UNDOC_MEMBERS and BRIEF_MEMBER_DESC are set to NO, the
# brief descriptions will be completely suppressed.
# The default value is: YES.

REPEAT_BRIEF           = YES

# This tag implements a quasi-intelligent brief description abbreviator that is
# used to form the text in various listings. Each string in this list, if found
# as the leading text of the brief description, will be stripped from the text
# and the result, after processing the whole list, is used as the annotated
# text. Otherwise, the brief description is used as-is. If left blank, the
# following values are used ($name is automatically replaced with the name of
# the entity):The $name class, The $name widget, The $name file, is, provides,
# specifies, contains, represents, a, an and the.

ABBREVIATE_BRIEF       =

# If the ALWAYS_DETAILED_SEC and REPEAT_BRIEF tags are both set to YES then
# doxygen will generate a detailed section even if there is only a brief
# description.
# The default value is: NO.

ALWAYS_DETAILED_SEC    = NO

# If the INLINE_INHERITED_MEMB tag is set to YES, doxygen will show all
# inherited members of a class in the documentation of that class as if those
# members were ordinary class members. Constructors, destructors and assignment
# operators of the base classes will not be shown.
# The default value is: NO.

INLINE_INHERITED_MEMB  = NO

# If the FULL_PATH_NAMES tag is set to YES, doxygen will prepend the full path
# before files name in the file list and in the header files. If set to NO the
# shortest path that makes the file name unique will be used
# The default value is: YES.

FULL_PATH_NAMES        = NO

# The STRIP_FROM_PATH tag can be used to strip a user-defined part of the path.
# Stripping is only done if one of the specified strings matches the left-hand
# part of the path. The tag can be used to show relative paths in the file list.
# If left blank the directory from which doxygen is run is used as the path to
# strip.
#
# Note that you can specify absolute paths here, but also relative paths, which
# will be relative from the directory where doxygen is started.
# This tag requires that the tag FULL_PATH_NAMES is set to YES.

STRIP_FROM_PATH        =

# The STRIP_FROM_INC_PATH tag can be used to strip a user-defined part of the
# path mentioned in the documentation of a class, which tells the reader which
# header file to include in order to use a class. If left blank only the name of
# the header file containing the class definition is used. Otherwise one should
# specify the list of include paths that are normally passed to the compiler
# using the -I flag.

STRIP_FROM_INC_PATH    =

# If the SHORT_NAMES tag is set to YES, doxygen will generate much shorter (but
# less readable) file names. This can be useful is your file systems doesn't
# support long names like on DOS, Mac, or CD-ROM.
# The default value is: NO.

SHORT_NAMES            = YES

# If the JAVADOC_AUTOBRIEF tag is set to YES then doxygen will interpret the
# first line (until the first dot) of a Javadoc-style comment as the brief
# description. If set to NO, the Javadoc-style will behave just like regular Qt-
# style comments (thus requiring an explicit @brief command for a brief
# description.)
# The default value is: NO.

JAVADOC_AUTOBRIEF      = NO

# If the QT_AUTOBRIEF tag is set to YES then doxygen will interpret the first
# line (until the first dot) of a Qt-style comment as the brief description. If
# set to NO, the Qt-style will behave just like regular Qt-style comments (thus
# requiring an explicit \brief command for a brief description.)
# The default value is: NO.

QT_AUTOBRIEF           = NO

# The MULTILINE_CPP_IS_BRIEF tag can be set to YES to make doxygen treat a
# multi-line C++ special comment block (i.e. a block of //! or /// comments) as
# a brief description. This used to be the default behavior. The new default is
# to treat a multi-line C++ comment block as a detailed description. Set this
# tag to YES if you prefer the old behavior instead.
#
# Note that setting this tag to YES also means that rational rose comments are
# not recognized any more.
# The default value is: NO.

MULTILINE_CPP_IS_BRIEF = NO

# If the INHERIT_DOCS tag is set to YES then an undocumented member inherits the
# documentation from any documented member that it re-implements.
# The default value is: YES.

INHERIT_DOCS           = YES

# If the SEPARATE_MEMBER_PAGES tag is set to YES then doxygen will produce a new
# page for each member. If set to NO, the documentation of a member will be part
# of the file/class/namespace that contains it.
# The default value is: NO.

SEPARATE_MEMBER_PAGES  = NO

# The TAB_SIZE tag can be used to set the number of spaces in a tab. Doxygen
# uses this value to replace tabs by spaces in code fragments.
# Minimum value: 1, maximum value: 16, default value: 4.

TAB_SIZE               = 4

# This tag can be used to specify a number of aliases that act as commands in
# the documentation. An alias has the form:
# name=value
# For example adding
# "sideeffect=@par Side Effects:\n"
# will allow you to put the command \sideeffect (or @sideeffect) in the
# documentation, which will result in a user-defined paragraph with heading
# "Side Effects:". You can put \n's in the value part of an alias to insert
# newlines.

ALIASES                =

# This tag can be used to specify a number of word-keyword mappings (TCL only).
# A mapping has the form "name=value". For example adding "class=itcl::class"
# will allow you to use the command class in the itcl::class meaning.

TCL_SUBST              =

# Set the OPTIMIZE_OUTPUT_FOR_C tag to YES if your project consists of C sources
# only. Doxygen will then generate output that is more tailored for C. For
# instance, some of the names that are used will be different. The list of all
# members will be omitted, etc.
# The default value is: NO.

OPTIMIZE_OUTPUT_FOR_C  = NO

# Set the OPTIMIZE_OUTPUT_JAVA tag to YES if your project consists of Java or
# Python sources only. Doxygen will then generate output that is more tailored
# for that language. For instance, namespaces will be presented as packages,
# qualified scopes will look different, etc.
# The default value is: NO.

OPTIMIZE_OUTPUT_JAVA   = NO

# Set the OPTIMIZE_FOR_FORTRAN tag to YES if your project consists of Fortran
# sources. Doxygen will then generate output that is tailored for Fortran.
# The default value is: NO.

OPTIMIZE_FOR_FORTRAN   = NO

# Set the OPTIMIZE_OUTPUT_VHDL tag to YES if your project consists of VHDL
# sources. Doxygen will then generate output that is tailored for VHDL.
# The default value is: NO.

OPTIMIZE_OUTPUT_VHDL   = NO

# Doxygen selects the parser to use depending on the extension of the files it
# parses. With this tag you can assign which parser to use for a given
# extension. Doxygen has a built-in mapping, but you can override or extend it
# using this tag. The format is ext=language, where ext is a file extension, and
# language is one of the parsers supported by doxygen: IDL, Java, Javascript,
# C#, C, C++, D, PHP, Objective-C, Python, Fortran (fixed format Fortran:
# FortranFixed, free formatted Fortran: FortranFree, unknown formatted Fortran:
# Fortran. In the later case the parser tries to guess whether the code is fixed
# or free formatted code, this is the default for Fortran type files), VHDL. For
# instance to make doxygen treat .inc files as Fortran files (default is PHP),
# and .f files as C (default is Fortran), use: inc=Fortran f=C.
#
# Note: For files without extension you can use no_extension as a placeholder.
#
# Note that for custom extensions you also need to set FILE_PATTERNS otherwise
# the files are not read by doxygen.

EXTENSION_MAPPING      =

# If the MARKDOWN_SUPPORT tag is enabled then doxygen pre-processes all comments
# according to the Markdown format, which allows for more readable
# documentation. See http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/ for details.
# The output of markdown processing is further processed by doxygen, so you can
# mix doxygen, HTML, and XML commands with Markdown formatting. Disable only in
# case of backward compatibilities issues.
# The default value is: YES.

MARKDOWN_SUPPORT       = YES

# When enabled doxygen tries to link words that correspond to documented
# classes, or namespaces to their corresponding documentation. Such a link can
# be prevented in individual cases by putting a % sign in front of the word or
# globally by setting AUTOLINK_SUPPORT to NO.
# The default value is: YES.

AUTOLINK_SUPPORT       = YES

# If you use STL classes (i.e. std::string, std::vector, etc.) but do not want
# to include (a tag file for) the STL sources as input, then you should set this
# tag to YES in order to let doxygen match functions declarations and
# definitions whose arguments contain STL classes (e.g. func(std::string);
# versus func(std::string) {}). This also make the inheritance and collaboration
# diagrams that involve STL classes more complete and accurate.
# The default value is: NO.

BUILTIN_STL_SUPPORT    = YES

# If you use Microsoft's C++/CLI language, you should set this option to YES to
# enable parsing support.
# The default value is: NO.

CPP_CLI_SUPPORT        = NO

# Set the SIP_SUPPORT tag to YES if your project consists of sip (see:
# http://www.riverbankcomputing.co.uk/software/sip/intro) sources only. Doxygen
# will parse them like normal C++ but will assume all classes use public instead
# of private inheritance when no explicit protection keyword is present.
# The default value is: NO.

SIP_SUPPORT            = NO

# For Microsoft's IDL there are propget and propput attributes to indicate
# getter and setter methods for a property. Setting this option to YES will make
# doxygen to replace the get and set methods by a property in the documentation.
# This will only work if the methods are indeed getting or setting a simple
# type. If this is not the case, or you want to show the methods anyway, you
# should set this option to NO.
# The default value is: YES.

IDL_PROPERTY_SUPPORT   = NO

# If member grouping is used in the documentation and the DISTRIBUTE_GROUP_DOC
# tag is set to YES then doxygen will reuse the documentation of the first
# member in the group (if any) for the other members of the group. By default
# all members of a group must be documented explicitly.
# The default value is: NO.

DISTRIBUTE_GROUP_DOC   = NO

# If one adds a struct or class to a group and this option is enabled, then also
# any nested class or struct is added to the same group. By default this option
# is disabled and one has to add nested compounds explicitly via \ingroup.
# The default value is: NO.

GROUP_NESTED_COMPOUNDS = NO

# Set the SUBGROUPING tag to YES to allow class member groups of the same type
# (for instance a group of public functions) to be put as a subgroup of that
# type (e.g. under the Public Functions section). Set it to NO to prevent
# subgrouping. Alternatively, this can be done per class using the
# \nosubgrouping command.
# The default value is: YES.

SUBGROUPING            = YES

# When the INLINE_GROUPED_CLASSES tag is set to YES, classes, structs and unions
# are shown inside the group in which they are included (e.g. using \ingroup)
# instead of on a separate page (for HTML and Man pages) or section (for LaTeX
# and RTF).
#
# Note that this feature does not work in combination with
# SEPARATE_MEMBER_PAGES.
# The default value is: NO.

INLINE_GROUPED_CLASSES = NO

# When the INLINE_SIMPLE_STRUCTS tag is set to YES, structs, classes, and unions
# with only public data fields or simple typedef fields will be shown inline in
# the documentation of the scope in which they are defined (i.e. file,
# namespace, or group documentation), provided this scope is documented. If set
# to NO, structs, classes, and unions are shown on a separate page (for HTML and
# Man pages) or section (for LaTeX and RTF).
# The default value is: NO.

INLINE_SIMPLE_STRUCTS  = NO

# When TYPEDEF_HIDES_STRUCT tag is enabled, a typedef of a struct, union, or
# enum is documented as struct, union, or enum with the name of the typedef. So
# typedef struct TypeS {} TypeT, will appear in the documentation as a struct
# with name TypeT. When disabled the typedef will appear as a member of a file,
# namespace, or class. And the struct will be named TypeS. This can typically be
# useful for C code in case the coding convention dictates that all compound
# types are typedef'ed and only the typedef is referenced, never the tag name.
# The default value is: NO.

TYPEDEF_HIDES_STRUCT   = NO

# The size of the symbol lookup cache can be set using LOOKUP_CACHE_SIZE. This
# cache is used to resolve symbols given their name and scope. Since this can be
# an expensive process and often the same symbol appears multiple times in the
# code, doxygen keeps a cache of pre-resolved symbols. If the cache is too small
# doxygen will become slower. If the cache is too large, memory is wasted. The
# cache size is given by this formula: 2^(16+LOOKUP_CACHE_SIZE). The valid range
# is 0..9, the default is 0, corresponding to a cache size of 2^16=65536
# symbols. At the end of a run doxygen will report the cache usage and suggest
# the optimal cache size from a speed point of view.
# Minimum value: 0, maximum value: 9, default value: 0.

LOOKUP_CACHE_SIZE      = 0

#---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Build related configuration options

# If the EXTRACT_ALL tag is set to YES, doxygen will assume all entities in
# documentation are documented, even if no documentation was available. Private
# class members and static file members will be hidden unless the
# EXTRACT_PRIVATE respectively EXTRACT_STATIC tags are set to YES.
# Note: This will also disable the warnings about undocumented members that are
# normally produced when WARNINGS is set to YES.
# The default value is: NO.

# for Java sources.
# The default value is: YES.

EXTRACT_LOCAL_CLASSES  = YES

# This flag is only useful for Objective-C code. If set to YES, local methods,

# included.
# The default value is: NO.

EXTRACT_LOCAL_METHODS  = NO

# If this flag is set to YES, the members of anonymous namespaces will be
# extracted and appear in the documentation as a namespace called

# are hidden.
# The default value is: NO.

EXTRACT_ANON_NSPACES   = NO

# If the HIDE_UNDOC_MEMBERS tag is set to YES, doxygen will hide all
# undocumented members inside documented classes or files. If set to NO these

# The default value is: NO.

HIDE_UNDOC_MEMBERS     = NO

# If the HIDE_UNDOC_CLASSES tag is set to YES, doxygen will hide all
# undocumented classes that are normally visible in the class hierarchy. If set

# The default value is: NO.

HIDE_UNDOC_CLASSES     = NO

# The default value is: NO.

HIDE_FRIEND_COMPOUNDS  = NO

# If the HIDE_IN_BODY_DOCS tag is set to YES, doxygen will hide any

HIDE_IN_BODY_DOCS      = NO

# The INTERNAL_DOCS tag determines if documentation that is typed after a

# will be excluded. Set it to YES to include the internal documentation.
# The default value is: NO.

INTERNAL_DOCS          = NO

# If the CASE_SENSE_NAMES tag is set to NO then doxygen will only generate file
# names in lower-case letters. If set to YES, upper-case letters are also
# allowed. This is useful if you have classes or files whose names only differ
# in case and if your file system supports case sensitive file names. Windows
# and Mac users are advised to set this option to NO.
# The default value is: system dependent.

CASE_SENSE_NAMES       = YES

# If the HIDE_SCOPE_NAMES tag is set to NO then doxygen will show members with
